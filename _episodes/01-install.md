### Docker installation

Before we begin, we need to install Docker!

- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/)
- [Mac OS X](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/)
- [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/

### What's `Docker Toolbox`? Do I need it?

If your OS does not meet the requirements of `Docker for Windows` or `Docker for Mac` you will need to install VirtualBox and Docker Toolbox.


### When your installation is compelted open a terminal (console/cmd) and type:

`docker pull bids/base_fsl`
